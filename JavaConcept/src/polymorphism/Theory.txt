Polymorphism- Same name+Multiple forms(action/behaviour)

Types of Polymorphism- 

(1) Compile Time Polymorphism/Early Binding/Static Binding/Overloading

(a) Overloading--> Same method name but different signature. 
	i.e- In a single class, we have multiple methods with same name but different method signatures.

** What is a method signature?
Ans: A method signature is generally the parameters that differentiate two methods with same name.
So while calling the method, we can choose which one to call by differentiating the parameters passed.

** Can we achieve Overloading by keeping the method signature same and changing the return type?
Ans: No. It is not possible. Only change in parameters/arguments will differentiate two methods with same name 
and thus we can achieve overloading.

(2) Runtime Polymorphism/ Late Binding/ Dynamic Binding/ Overriding
